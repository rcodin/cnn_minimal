The library has three levels.
	i) first front end which parses the configuration and initiates the tiler module.
	ii) the tiler module decides on tile size and runs the low level CNN kernels.
	iii) The low level kernels which are basically normal CNN layer implementation.

Test it on a raspberry pi.
